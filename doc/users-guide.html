	<h2>Quick Start</h2>
	<p>
		See the sample code in the <tt>test</tt> directory to quickly get up to speed. Run the sample as follows:
<pre>
$ java -jar rngom-sample.jar &lt;schema file>
</pre>
	
	
	<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
	<p>
		RNGOM defines several interface sets through which applications interact with RNGOM.
	</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Parseable
		<dd>
			<tt>Parseable</tt> is either a <tt>CompactParseable</tt> or <tt>SAXParseable</tt>, and it represents the source RELAX NG schema file to be parsed. RNGOM can parse them by invoking their <tt>parse</tt> method.
		
		<dt>SchemaBuilder and the ast.builder package
		<dd>
			The <tt>ast.builder</tt> package (rooted at <tt>SchemaBuilder</tt>) defines a set of callback interfaces to parse RELAX NG schemas. When the <tt>Parseable.parse</tt> method is called, it takes a <tt>SchemaBuilder</tt> as a parameter and then "parses" a schema by firing appropriate callbacks through the interfaces of the <tt>ast.builder</tt> package.
		<dd>
			Application can implement those interfaces to build application-specific object model from RELAX NG schemas.
	
		<dt>ast.om package
		<dd>
			This package is a set of marker interfaces that defines the RELAX NG object model. These markers are used simply to increase type-safety throughout RNGOM. If you choose to define the custom object model, it has to implement those markers.
	
		<dt>org.relaxng.datatype package
		<dd>
			This package defines a set of interfaces for pluggable datatypes. See <a href="http://relaxng.sourceforge.net/datatype/java/apiDocs/">its javadoc</a> for more details.
	</dl>
	
	
	
	<h2>Default Implementations</h2>
	<p>
		RNGOM comes with a few default implementations of the above interface sets.
	
	<dl>
		<dt>rngom.nc package
		<dd>
			This package defines a default implementation of the name class portion of the <tt>ast.om</tt>/<tt>ast.builder</tt> packages.
		<dt>rngom.binary package
		<dd>
			This package defines a default implementation of the rest of the <tt>ast.om</tt>/<tt>ast.builder</tt> packages. This package models the simple syntax of RELAX NG, and it doesn't carry any annotations, comments, nor location information. This implementation might be useful for applications such as validators, editors.
	</dl>
	
	
	
	<h2>Doing Full Check</h2>
	<p>
		The RELAX NG spec defines a series of "restrictions" that correct RELAX NG schemas have to follow. To check those, change your following normal code:
<pre>
Parseable parseable = ...;
YourParsedPattern = (YourParsedPattern)parseable.parse(schemaBuilder);
</pre>
	<p>
		... to the following:
<pre>
import org.kohsuke.rngom.ast.util.CheckingSchemaBuilder;

Parseable parseable = ...;
YourParsedPattern = (YourParsedPattern)parseable.parse(new CheckingSchemaBuilder(schemaBuilder,errorHandler));
</pre>
	<p>
		See its javadoc for more details. Doing this guarantees that your application will reject all the incorrect schemas.
	
	
	
	<h2>Writing Your Own SchemaBuilder</h2>
	<p>
		For better or worse, James Clark didn't leave much comment in his code, so you are more than welcome to contribute javadoc on those interfaces :-)
	<p>
		The abovementioned sample program prints out the callbacks and their parameters, so try it to learn about how the callbacks are called.
